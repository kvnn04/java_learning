Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators are used to perform common mathematical operations.

Operator	Name	Description	Example	Try it
+	Addition	Adds together two values	x + y	
-	Subtraction	Subtracts one value from another	x - y	
*	Multiplication	Multiplies two values	x * y	
/	Division	Divides one value by another	x / y	
%	Modulus	Returns the division remainder	x % y	
++	Increment	Increases the value of a variable by 1	++x	
--	Decrement	Decreases the value of a variable by 1	--x

Assignment Operators:
Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.

In the example below, we use the assignment operator (=) to assign the value 10 to a variable called x.

example Assignment Operators
operator         example     same as
=	    x = 5	    x = 5	
+=	    x += 3	    x = x + 3	
-=	    x -= 3	    x = x - 3	
*=	    x *= 3	    x = x * 3	
/=	    x /= 3	    x = x / 3	
%=	    x %= 3	    x = x % 3	
&=	    x &= 3	    x = x & 3	
|=	    x |= 3	    x = x | 3	
^=	    x ^= 3	    x = x ^ 3	
>>=	    x >>= 3	    x = x >> 3	
<<=	    x <<= 3	    x = x << 3

Comparison Operators

Comparison operators are used to compare two values (or variables). This is important in programming,
because it helps us to find answers and make decisions.

==	Equal to	x == y	
!=	Not equal	x != y	
>	Greater than	x > y	
<	Less than	x < y	
>=	Greater than or equal to	x >= y	
<=	Less than or equal to	x <= y

Logical Operators

You can also test for true or false values with logical operators.

&& 	Logical and	Returns true if both statements are true	x < 5 &&  x < 10	
|| 	Logical or	Returns true if one of the statements is true	x < 5 || x < 4	
!	Logical not	Reverse the result, returns false if the result is true	!(x < 5 && x < 10)
